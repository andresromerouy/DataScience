# [DS-02E] Example - Amazon jobs

## Introduction

Job offers are posted at the **Amazon Jobs** website (`amazon.jobs/en-gb`). Given the interest of these data for the community, a **web scraping** project at IESE Business School was started, with the focus on this website. At that time (no longer, unfortunately), more than 50,000 job offers were posted there. It was discovered that the information shown at the Amazon Jobs pages was loaded from JSON documents which could be accessed directly at `amazon.jobs/en-gb/search.json`. So the project was reoriented and the data were extracted directly from the JSON documents, captured by playing with the URL parameters at that site.

This example is based on a data subset resulting from selecting the job category **Software Development** and the business category **Amazon Web Services** (AWS).

## The data set

The file `amzn.csv` (zipped) contains data for 8,116 software developement positions at AWS, captured in November 2021. The variables are:

* `id`, a unique identifier for the position. Example: '996246'.

* `title`, the title of the job, more or less descriptive. Example: 'Senior Software Dev Engineer'.

* `company_name`, the name of the company, within the orbit of AWS. There 65 unique company names in this data set. Example: 'Amazon.com Services LLC'.

* `description`, a description of the job, containing specific detail, but also a dose of bombastic rhetoric. Example: 'Are you passionate about enterprise-wide scale compliance management? Are you excited about impactful technical projects ...'.

* `basic_qualifications`, a list of generic qualifications for the job. Example: '4+ years of professional software development experience. 3+ years of programming experience ...'.

* `preferred_qualifications`, a list of more specific qualifications. Example: '6+ years experience building high scale distributed systems that handle big amounts of data. Strong knowledge of data structures, algorithms, and designing for performance, scalability, availability, and internet and OS security fundamentals ...'.

* `job_type`, either 'full-time' or 'part-time' (a few cases).

* `location`, the location of the position. Example: 'US, WA, Seattle'.

* `posted_date`, the date the position was posted at Amazon Jobs website, as 'yyyy-mm-dd'.

* `updated_time`, time since the data were updated at the website. Example: '3 months'.

* `team`, a generic indication of the team in which the position is offered, in a a specific terminology of Amazon. There are 23 such teams in this data set. Example: 'team-sde-primary'.

### Questions

Q1. Leaving aside the job ID, which is unique for every job posting, how many duplicates do you find in this data set? Drop the duplicates, so all the positions are different, in at least one field. 

Q2. Which are the top-ten locations for software developement at AWS? Suppose that a potential candidate is interested in finding a position in India. Does Amazon have something for him/her? In which locations? 

Q3. Programming languages are often mentioned in the basic qualifications field, and C is a classic. Which flavor of C is preferred here, C++ or C#?

Q4. How often is experience mentioned in the preferred qualifications field?

# Importing the data

We use here the Pandas funcion `read_csv()` to import the data. First, we import the package:

```
In [1]: import pandas as pd
```

The source file is in a GitHub repository, so we use a remote path to get access. The source file comes zipped, but `.read_csv()` can manage this without any specification if the file extension is `.zip`. With the argument `index_col=0`, the first column of the CSV file, whose header is `id` is taken as the index, so te resulting data frame will have 10 columns.

``` 
In [2]: path = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cinnData/DataSci/main/Data/'
   ...: filename = path + 'amzn.csv.zip'
   ...: df = pd.read_csv(filename, index_col=0)
```

## Exploring the data

To explore the data set, we use the standard Pandas methods. First, the method `.info()` prints a report of the data frame content. There are no missing values.

```
In [3]: df.info()
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
Int64Index: 8116 entries, 996246 to 1004288
Data columns (total 10 columns):
 #   Column                    Non-Null Count  Dtype 
---  ------                    --------------  ----- 
 0   title                     8116 non-null   object
 1   company_name              8116 non-null   object
 2   description               8116 non-null   object
 3   basic_qualifications      8116 non-null   object
 4   preferred_qualifications  8116 non-null   object
 5   job_type                  8116 non-null   object
 6   location                  8116 non-null   object
 7   posted_date               8116 non-null   object
 8   updated_time              8116 non-null   object
 9   team                      8116 non-null   object
dtypes: object(10)
memory usage: 697.5+ KB
```

Second, `.head()` displays the first five rows. The datqa look as expected, so far.

```
In [4]: df.head()

## Q1. Count and drop duplicates

``` 
In [5]: df.duplicated().sum()
Out[5]: 366
``` 

```
In [6]: df.index.duplicated().sum()
Out[6]: 0
```

```
In [7]: df = df.drop_duplicates()
   ...: df.shape
Out[7]: (7750, 10)
```

## Q2. Top locations for software developers at Amazon

The top locations for software developers at Amazon can be spotted with the method `.value_counts()`. First we see that that there 174 distinct locations in the data set. 

```
In [8]: df['location'].value_counts().shape
Out[8]: (174,)
```

Now, with `.head(10)`, we select the top ten.

```
In [9]: df['location'].value_counts().head(10)
Out[9]: 
US, WA, Seattle           3009
US, VA, Arlington          562
CA, BC, Vancouver          530
US, MA, Boston             297
US, NY, New York           291
US, VA, Herndon            269
US, CA, East Palo Alto     258
US, WA, Bellevue           200
US, TX, Austin             169
DE, BE, Berlin             152
Name: location, dtype: int64
```

```
In [10]: df['location'][df['location'].str[:2] == 'IN'].value_counts()
Out[10]: 
IN, KA, Bangalore      129
IN, TS, Hyderabad       41
IN, TN, Chennai          6
IN, MH, Maharashtra      1
IN                       1
IN, HR, Gurgaon          1
IN, Hyderabad            1
Name: location, dtype: int64
```

```

In [11]: df['location'][df['location'].str.contains('^IN', regex=True)].value_counts()
Out[11]: 
IN, KA, Bangalore      129
IN, TS, Hyderabad       41
IN, TN, Chennai          6
IN, MH, Maharashtra      1
IN                       1
IN, HR, Gurgaon          1
IN, Hyderabad            1
Name: location, dtype: int64
```

## Q3. Programming languages in the basic qualifications field

```
In [12]: df['basic_qualifications'].str.contains('c#', case=False).mean().round(3)
Out[12]: 0.64
```

```
In [13]: df['basic_qualifications'].str.contains('c+', case=False, regex=False).mean().round(3)
Out[13]: 0.72
```

```
In [14]: df['basic_qualifications'].str.contains('c+', case=False).mean().round(3)
Out[14]: 1.0
```

```
In [15]: df['basic_qualifications'].str.contains('c\+', case=False).mean().round(3)
Out[15]: 0.72
```

An alternative approach.

```
In [16]: bags = df['basic_qualifications'].str.lower().str.findall('\w+\+*')
    ...: bags.head()
Out[16]:

```

## Q4. Experience mentioned in the preferred qualifications field

```
In [17]: df['preferred_qualifications'].str.contains('experience', case=False).mean().round(3)
Out[17]: 0.903
```

Expressions like '3+ years' or similar, with or without the word experience.

```
In [18]: df['preferred_qualifications'].str.count('\+?[0-9]\+? years').value_counts()
Out[18]: 
0    6160
1    1209

## Homework

1. Positions incomplete.

2. What happens if in question Q3 we use 'c++' instead of 'c+'?

3. Is Java more demanded than C++ in the basic qualifications field? Take care of distinguish Java from JavaScript, which is a different beast. 

4. When the basic qualifications specifiy a number of years, which is the most frequent number?
