# [DS-02] String data in Python

## Strings

A **string** is a sequence of **characters**. This includes the (English) alphanumeric characters and also special characters like white space, punctuation, etc. Other symbols, like emoticons, can also appear in your data, specially in social networks data. Besides that, you can also find letters from various languages (Spanish, Portuguese, etc) and alphabets (Cyrillic, hiragana, etc), and even ideographs (such as Han characters).

There is a basic set of 127 characters, called the **ASCII characters**, which are encoded in the same way by all the computers, so you will never have trouble with them. They include the English letters (without accents), the numbers, basic punctuation (not curly quote marks or long dashes), white space, **control characters** such as the new line, represented in programming languages as `\n`, and other well known symbols, such as the dollar (`$`) and the hash (`#`) symbols. The complete list can be easily found in Internet.

In computers, characters are encoded as numbers to be manageable. Non-ASCII characters can be encoded by different computers or different text editors in different ways. Mind that, if you capture string data on your own, you will probably find some of these characters in your data. Even when the documents are expected to be in English, they can be contaminated by other languages: Han characters, German dieresis, Spanish e√±e, etc.

The preferred **encoding** is **UTF-8** (`utf-8`), which is the default in Macintosh and Linux computers. Importing from and exporting to text files with Pandas, the argument `encoding` allows you to manage both UTF-8 and the alternative encoding **Latin-1** (`latin1`). Windows computers use their own system, which is region specific. In US and Western Europe, this is **Windows-1252**, which is very close to Latin-1, though not exactly the same.

## Strings as sequences

In Python, strings and lists are two types of **sequences**, and, for many purposes, a string can be regarded as a list of characters. So, some basic methods are common to lists and strings. Let us see this with a simple example.

```
In [1]: iese = 'IESE Business School'
```

First, the function `len()` gives you the number of characters of a string:

```
In [2]: len(iese)
Out[2]: 20
```

Also, a **substring** can be extracted from a string just as a sublist is extracted from a list:

```
In [3]: iese[5:]
Out[3]: 'Business School'
```

In Python, strings are pasted as lists, with the plus sign (`+`):

```
In [4]: iese[:4] + ', A way to learn'
Out[4]: 'IESE, A way to learn'
```

A difference between strings and lists is found in the use of the **membership operator** `in`. For strings, it can be used to relate, not only a character to a string, but a substring to a string:

```
In [5]: 'IE' in iese
Out[5]: True
```

## Python string methods

Python also has a collection of specific methods for manipulating strings. For instance, **conversion to lowercase**:

```
In [6]: iese.lower()
Out[6]: 'iese business school'
```

Conversion to uppercase is performed in a similar way. The typical *Find and Replace* method of text editors is implemented in Python by the method `.replace()`:

```
In [7]: iese.replace('IESE', 'Iese')
Out[7]: 'Iese Business School'
```

You can split a string with the method `.split()`. The split can be based on any **separator**. If no separator is specified, any white space string (containing only white space, line breaks or tabs) is a separator.

```
In [8]: iese.split()
Out[8]: ['IESE', 'Business', 'School']
```

```
In [9]: iese.split('i')
Out[9]: ['IESE Bus', 'ness School']
```

Finally, the method `.count()` counts **the number of occurrences** of a pattern within a string:

```
In [10]: iese.count('s')
Out[10]: 3
```

## Pandas string methods

Pandas provides **vectorized** versions of the above methods for series. They return a series of the same length, in which each term results from applying a string method to the corresponding term of the original series. 

To illustrate these methods, we introduce a first example of a Pandas string series, containing the names of US presidents. The example includes an **empty string** and a **missing value**, for diversity. The `None` entry, which stands for a missing value, could be replaced by `numpy.nan` here.

```
In [11]: import pandas as pd
```

```
In [12]: pres = pd.Series(['Donald Trump', 'Joe Biden', '', None])
    ...: pres
Out[12]: 
0    Donald Trump
1       Joe Biden
2                
3            None
dtype: object
```

The method `str.len()` is a vectorized version of the function `len()`, explained above. So, it returns the length of every term of a string series. `.str` is just a flag for string methods in Pandas. In this example, the **empty string** (`''`) has length zero. Since `None` has no length, a `NaN` value has been returned as the fourth term. Also, the series has then been converted by Python to data type `float`, to cope with that (it would be `int` if all the terms had length).

```
In [13]: pres.str.len()
Out[13]: 
0    12.0
1     9.0
2     0.0
3     NaN
dtype: float64
```

We can also **slice** the terms of a string series as we do with a single string, adding the flag `.str`. For instance, the initials of the presidents can be extracted as:

```
In [14]: pres.str[0]
Out[14]: 
0       D
1       J
2     NaN
3    None
dtype: object
```

The methods `.lower().`, `.replace()`, `.count()` and `.split()` are directly incorporated to Pandas, as shown in the following examples.

```
In [15]: pres.str.lower()
Out[15]: 
0    donald trump
1       joe biden
2                
3            None
dtype: object
```

```
In [16]: pres.str.replace(' ', '-')
Out[16]: 
0    Donald-Trump
1       Joe-Biden
2                
3            None
dtype: object
```

```
In [17]: pres.str.split()
Out[17]: 
0    [Donald, Trump]
1       [Joe, Biden]
2                 []
3               None
dtype: object
```

Note that `.str.split()` returns a series whose terms are lists (of different lengths). This series has data type `object`, which in Pandas means anything that is not Boolean or numeric. The method `.count()` comes vectorized in Pandas in an obvious way:

```
In [18]: pres.str.count('e')
Out[18]: 
0    0.0
1    2.0
2    0.0
3    NaN
dtype: float64
```

The method `.str.contains()` provides a vectorized version of the statement `substr in str` which has been discussed above. It returns a Boolean series. 

```
In [19]: pres.str.contains('a')
Out[19]: 
0     True
1    False
2    False
3     None
dtype: object
```

`.str.contains()`  can be used to filter out documents. For instance, it drops Donald Trump from the presidents list in the following example.

```
In [20]: pres = pres[~(pres.isna())]
    ...: pres[~pres.str.contains('a')]
Out[20]: 
1    Joe Biden
2             
dtype: object
```

* *Note*. `~` is the logical operator `not` for Boolean series. It turns `True` into `False` and conversely.

Finally, the method `.str.findall()` extracts **matching patterns** from the terms of a string series. It returns, for every term, a list containing all the occurrences of that pattern. 

```
In [21]: pres.str.findall('e')
Out[21]: 
0        []
1    [e, e]
2        []
dtype: object
```

## Regular expressions

Quite often, the transformations performed by the methods described above can be simplified by means of **regular expressions**. More specifically, they can be used as the first argument in the methods `.str.contains`, `.str.findall`, `.str.replace`, `.str.split` and `.str.count`.

A regular expression is a pattern which describes a collection of strings. Among them, **character classes** are the simplest case. They are built by enclosing a collection of characters in square brackets. The square brackets indicate *any of the characters enclosed*. For instance, `[0-9]` stands for any digit, and `[A-Z]` for any capital letter. Two simple examples follow.

```
In [22]: bio = pd.Series(['I was born in 1954', 'My phone is +34 932 534 200'])
    ...: bio.str.replace('[a-z]', 'x', regex=True)
Out[22]: 
0             I xxx xxxx xx 1954
1    Mx xxxxx xx +34 932 534 200
dtype: object
```

```
In [23]: bio.str.replace('[0-9]', 'x', regex=True)
Out[23]: 
0             I was born in xxxx
1    My phone is +xx xxx xxx xxx
dtype: object
```

The default value of the parameter `regex` in `.str.replace()` is currently `regex=False` (Pandas 2.0.3), but this has recently changed. `.str.split()` and `.str.contains()` also admit a `regex` argument, but the default is `regex=None` for the first one and `regex=True` for the second one. To avoid confusion, it is better to specify a `regex` value for these three methods. To make things worse, `.str.findall()`  and `.str.count()` don't admit a `regex` argument, and they always read the pattern as a regular expression. Sorry about the mess!
 
Character classes get more powerful when complemented with **quantifiers**. For instance, followed by a plus sign (`+`), a character class indicates a sequence of any length. So, `[0-9]+` indicates any sequence of digits, therefore any number, and `[a-z]+` indicates any word in lowercase (using only English letters). We can also specify the length of the sequence, as in `[A-Z]{2}`, or the minimum and maximum length, as in `[0-9]{1,3}`.

Let us see next the quantifier effect in one of the preceding examples:

```
In [24]: bio.str.replace('[a-z]+', 'x', regex=True)
Out[24]: 
0              I x x x 1954
1    Mx x x +34 932 534 200
dtype: object
```

The regular expressions `\w` and `\W`, which stand for any character that can be part of a word and the contrary, respectively, are useful in practice. The following example uses `\W`, with a quantifier, to split by either white space or punctuation (or both). 

```
In [25]: bio.str.split('\W+')
Out[25]: 
0              [I, was, born, in, 1954]
1    [My, phone, is, 34, 932, 534, 200]
dtype: object
```

With **wildcards**, you can match pieces of text whose exact content you do not know, other than the fact that they share a common pattern or structure (*e.g*. phone numbers or zip codes). The wildcard of Python regular expressions is the **dot** (`.`), which matches any single character. 

```
In [26]: people = pd.Series(['John - male', 'Nancy - female', 'Bruno - male'])
    ...: people.str.replace(' - .+', '', regex=True)
Out[26]: 
0     John
1    Nancy
2    Bruno
dtype: object
```

Some symbols, like the quantifier `+` or the wildcard `.` have a special role in regular expressions. You have to be careful when including them in a search string in the methods `.str.findall()` and `.str.count()`, because they can give unexpected results. The following example illustrates this. 

```
In [27]: comment = pd.Series(['Sally and Tim came to dinner. A nice couple.'])
    ...: comment.str.count('.')
Out[27]: 
0    44
dtype: int64
```

But, if you write these characters with a **escape character** (`\`), they are read literally:

```
In [27]: comment.str.count('\.')
Out[27]: 
0    2
dtype: int64
```

## Homework

1. Write a function which anonymizes credit card numbers, turning, for instance, '2875765488882745' into 'Credit card ****745'. Check that your function does the job with a short series containing credit card numbers.

2. A VISA Electron card number has 16 digits. As in any credit card, the first digits identify the card issuer. In the case of VISA Electron, the **issuer identification number** (IIN) can be 4026, 417500, 4508, 4844, 4913 or 4917. Write a function which identifies VISA Electron card numbers. Check that your function does the job with a short series containing credit card numbers.

3. You can see below a list containing the URL's for some **job postings** at the London-based financial technology company Wise. The sequence of digits in the middle of the URL make the ID of the position. Write a function which extracts a list of such URL's to a list containing their ID's.

```

4. Create a data frame with two columns, `first_name` and `last_name`, filling it the first and last names of the US presidents in the series `pres`. Replace the names in `pres` by 'Donald John Trump' and 'Joseph Robinette Biden' and create a data frame with three columns `first_name`, `mid_name` and `last_name`, splitting the three-part names. How would you manage this if the data include names with the middle component, such as 'Pedro S√°nchez'?
