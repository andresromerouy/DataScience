# Assignment 1

This assignment is based on the examples **Assessing home values in West Roxbury** and **Barcelona Airbnb listings**.

### Questions on Roxbury example

Q1. How is the distribution of the living area expressed as a percentage of the gross area? Is there an association with the home value?

### Questions on the Airbnb example

Q2. A controversial issue about Airbnb is that, in spite of starting as a peer-to-peer platform, it has evolved to one where some hosts can manage many listings, sometimes whole buildings. They could be so affecting the way the natives' life. Do you find many hosts in this situation in Barcelona?

Q3. As a continuation of the preceding exercise, pick the hosts with more than 100 listings and create a data subset containing only the listings managed by those hosts. Do you find that these particular hosts are focused on certain neighbourhoods? Do they have higher prices?
